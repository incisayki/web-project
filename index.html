  "My main inspiration is in  Scottish land and seascape. I enjoy using colour to define contours, structure and changing light sequences. I search out specific view points. I am equally inspired by the changing light sequences of the Western Isles and the dramatic view points of the Eastern coastline. I work predominantly in oil"..</h2>
