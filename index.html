  <h1>Pam Carter</h1>
  <h2>Pam Carter DA was born in Tanzania, East Africa. Her Scottish father and Austrian mother came to Glasgow when she was aged 13.
    Pam gained a degree at Glasgow School of Art and has lectured for many years in Schools and Colleges including lecturing at Falkirk College. She exhibited throughout this time. In 2003 she became a full time painter.

  "My main inspiration is in  Scottish land and seascape. I enjoy using colour to define contours, structure and changing light sequences. I search out specific view points. I am equally inspired by the changing light sequences of the Western Isles and the dramatic view points of the Eastern coastline. I work predominantly in oil"..</h2>
